## Objective
[Brief Objective]

### GitHub Project Description

The objective of this project is to explore the installation of VMware and Windows Server 2025. We will focus on creating, partitioning, allocating resources, and configuring a Windows Server 2025 Virtual Machine. 

Project components include:  
- Installing VMware on a Windows 11 desktop  
- Installing the Windows Server 2025 ISO on VMware  
- Creating a Virtual Machine, partitioning resources, and performing basic configuration  

The aim is to simplify the process of learning and applying best practices for installing VMware and the Windows Server 2025 ISO, creating a Virtual Machine, and establishing fundamental configurations.
